        <h2 class="reveal-text">Why IT Nanbargal Exists</h2>
        <p class="why-text">
          Most people start learning IT through YouTube videos, courses, and
          tutorials. This helps them understand the basics.
        </p>
        <p class="why-text">
          The real problem begins when they start working on real projects —
          errors appear, APIs fail, logic breaks, and deployment stops.
        </p>
        <p class="why-text">
          This is not because they are weak or not trying hard.<br />
          <strong>
            The real issue is the lack of proper guidance at the right time.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p class="why-text highlight">
          IT Nanbargal exists to fill this exact gap — with trusted guidance and
          real human support.

            <strong>Defined and accountable support process.</strong><br />
            Every request follows a structured flow — official email initiation,
            careful issue review, and guided resolution. Nothing is handled
            randomly or without context.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Individual attention to every issue.</strong><br />
            Each doubt is read, understood, and addressed based on the actual
            problem, not templates, automation, or copy-paste replies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Zero pressure decision-making.</strong><br />
            No forced upgrades, no artificial urgency, and no emotionally driven
            sales tactics. Users choose freely and transparently.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Strict respect for privacy and ownership.</strong><br />
            Personal information, project files, screenshots, and shared code
            always remain the user’s property and are never reused or disclosed
            without explicit consent.
